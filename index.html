      <h2>A quick intro...</h2>
      <p>
        I currently own two dogs, Brandi and Jangers. They are both rescues, female, and fixed. Neither of them particularly care for water, which is a bummer living so close to the beach. They have wildly different personalities.

      <h2>More on Brandi!</h2>
      <p>
        Brandi is some sort of Chocolate Lab mix, we are unsure of the other half. She is roughly 12 years old now, but as a former stray knowing an exact age is difficult. She is incredibly lazy, and always hungry. She is very nice, but sometimes she barks at nothing which can be annoying.

      <h2>More on Jangers!</h2>
      <p>
        Jangers is now somewhere around 6 years old. When I rescued her, she was only 9 months old, so I've had her since she was still fairly puppyish. She is a Beagle mix of some sort. Again, we do not know the other half, but she's definitely not full-blood Beagle. She is also quite a nice dog, but sticks her nose up at food a lot. She is the only dog I've owned that genuinely plays with dog toys.
